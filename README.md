# Chorchester

This project is a registry for members of the chambre choir and orchestra of the university of Hamburg. People can create accounts and fill their associated profiles with info.

Chorchester is intended to be a basic social network. For now, it is a way to provide a list of members with info like pictures and names to have an easier overview of the people in the ensembles.
